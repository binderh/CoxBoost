\item{RIF}{list obtained from a \code{\link{resample.CoxBoost}} call.}

\code{\link{resample.CoxBoost}} call.}

trajectory plot.}

plotting the different weights, default are gray shades.}

\item{yupperlim}{value for the upper y coordinate.}

\item{huge}{size of the labels plottet on the x-axis.}

\item{lowerRIFlimit}{cutoff RIF value: All covariates which have an
resampling inclusion frequency (RIF) greater or equal this lowerRIFlimit
value at any weight are presented in the stability trajectory plot.}

the right side of the plot.}

\value{
No value is returned, but the stability trajectory plot is
generated.

\description{
Plots the stability trajectories, i.e. the variable selection stability is
plotted in form of resampling inclusion frequencies for different weights
and a selection of different stably selected genes as obtained from a
resCoxBoost object fitted by \code{\link{resample.CoxBoost}}.
}
\details{
The \code{stabtrajec} function produces a visualization tool (stability
trajectory plot), which shows the RIFs as a function of weights for stably
selected covariates selected via \code{resample.CoxBoost}. With this tool it
can be shown that with weights between zero and one and so the additional
information from the observations of the not analyzed subgroup in comparison
to the standard subgroup analysis (weight near zero) can improve the
variable selection stability. The number of plotted covariates in this plot
depends on \code{lowerRIFlimit}. How many weights are plotted which are
element of \code{mix.list} can be changed with \code{plotmix}.
