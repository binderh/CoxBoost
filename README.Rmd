Cox-Likelihood Based Boosting for right-censored single-event survival tasks and competing risks.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CoxBoost from [GitHub](https://github.com/binderh/CoxBoost/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("binderh/CoxBoost")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to fit a `CoxBoost` model and predict on new data.


First, we generate some survival data with 10 informative covariates and define the train and test sets:
```{r example}
library(CoxBoost)
set.seed(42)

# generate survival data
n = 200; p = 100
beta = c(rep(1,10),rep(0,p-10))
x = matrix(rnorm(n*p),n,p)
real.time = -(log(runif(n)))/(10*exp(drop(x %*% beta)))
cens.time = rexp(n,rate=1/10)
status = ifelse(real.time <= cens.time,1,0)
obs.time = ifelse(real.time <= cens.time,real.time,cens.time)

# define training and test set
train.index = 1:150
test.index = 151:200
```

We fit CoxBoost to the training data and see the model's `summary()`:
```{r}
cbfit = CoxBoost(
  time = obs.time[train.index],
  status = status[train.index],
  x = x[train.index,],
  stepno = 300, penalty = 100
)

summary(cbfit)
```

Plot the mean partial log-likelihood for test set in every boosting step:
```{r}
step_pll = predict(
  cbfit,
  newdata = x[test.index,],
  newtime = obs.time[test.index],
  newstatus = status[test.index],
  at.step = 0:300, type = "logplik"
)

plot(step_pll)
```

Names of covariates with non-zero coefficients at boosting step with maximal test set partial log-likelihood:
```{r}
print(cbfit$xnames[cbfit$coefficients[which.max(step_pll),] != 0])
```

We refit the `CoxBoost` model but with covariates 1 and 2 as mandatory:
```{r}
cbfit_mand = CoxBoost(
  time = obs.time,
  status = status,
  x = x, 
  unpen.index = c(1,2), stepno = 100, penalty = 100
)

summary(cbfit_mand)
```
