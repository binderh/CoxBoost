Package: CoxBoost
Title: Provides routines for fitting Cox models by likelihood based
    boosting for single event survival data with right censoring or in the
    presence of competing risks. The methodology is described in Binder
    and Schumacher (2008) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-9-14> and Binder et al.
    (2009) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp088>.
